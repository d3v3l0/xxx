   {:title "On the Zone Theorem for Hyperplane Arrangements"
    :authors "Herbert Edelsbrunner, Raimund Seidel, and Micha Sharir"
    :link "http://pub.ist.ac.at/~edels/Papers/1993-J-02-OnZoneTheorem.pdf"
    :story "The story behind this one was told to me by my comp. geometry professor. In the late 80s the original Zone Theorem paper came out, and people started relying on it for their own results. At a conference a few years later, during the open problem session, someone (I think one of the authors?) went to the board and wrote down the question that the Zone Theorem answers. Everyone immediately recognized it and wondered why it was being presented as an open problem. Whoever it was said that they'd found a flaw in the proof and it needed to be fixed. Since everyone's results depended on it, they all pitched in to figure it out, and by the end of the conference they'd come up with a new, far simpler proof. My professor said it might be a good idea to fake this once in a while to try to get people to find simpler proofs of fundamental results. Anyway, this paper is the fixed version."}

I took my first computer graphics course as a sophomore and this paper made me realize how broad topics can come together to make something great. This paper and that course was the push that caused me to study applied math and look to learn from as many sources as possible."}

I spent the following semester figuring out how to view problems in terms of information, entropy and KL divergence. Any time I hear of an information theory problem I still get excited."}

    :story "When I first joined MCA I felt completely out of place, I had no idea what a distributed system was. I read a bunch of distributed systems papers to try to catch up and after reading Dynamo something finally clicked. Dynamo uses a lot of the most common distributed systems tricks and seeing them together help me understand each of them individually. I remember after reading the paper, I finally started understanding what Greenberg was talking about and could start contributing."}]}

   {:title "Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics"
    :authors "J. R. R. Tolkien"
    :link "https://books.google.com/books?id=_sU0bTfcIjYC&pg=PA14&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false"
    :story "Prior to being considered one of the most important works in Old English literature, Beowulf was only ever discussed as a source of information on Anglo-Saxon history. This essay, written by J. R. R. Tolkien in 1936, argued that Beowulf’s value as a poem is much greater than its value as a historical document.
 
The most impactful part of the essay for me is when Tolkien gives an allegory of a man who builds a tower from some old stones in his field. Some other people find that the stones are older than the tower, so they tear it down to try to learn more about stones’ past. The people are incredulous that the man would build a “nonsensical tower” from the stones and question why he would not restore the old house that the stones clearly came from. Tolkien completes the scene with the reflection, “But from the top of that tower the man had been able to look out upon the sea”. The other people only ever saw the value in the building blocks of the tower, and the potential history they represented. They never saw the value in the tower itself.
 
This helped me to realize the monumental importance of perspective, and to be constantly reevaluating how I am judging the things I encounter in my everyday life."}

    :story "This paper (and the more general delta of a type paper) really made a lot of things about algebraic data types and functional programming pop into place. I read it once, didn't get it, reread it a couple of times explained different ways, and once it clicked a LOT of things made a lot of sense, and I saw this beautiful connection between different areas of mathematics. More generally, it underscored just how powerful algebraic data types are, and how if we think about things in the right way, there are these really amazing answers lurking around."}

    :story "This is kind of an obscure paper that isn't really that consequential, even in the idris community... but basically it shows how you can use dependent types to create protocols that are checked by the compiler. I knew it was ~possible~, but to see an actual implementation in a language that I might want to use was really awesome, and it has really framed how I've thought about what I \"care about\" in types/fp... I doubt I'll get to really work on it for a while, but I fully believe that for at least certain things of enough importance, we can and should implement and verify in this way, fully leveraging the computer to minimize mistakes. And this paper showed me that it really is possible.}"}]}

In the slow motion downtime between days, I worked through it repeatedly.  By the end of the tour, I'd taken to compulsively doodling steps of the Graham Scan and other algorithms in comp geometry. I'd draw hundreds of points on a piece paper, then work through the Convex Hulls and Voronoi Diagrams until I started to feel better, less homesick, less crazy, more myself."}

You haven't read time, clocks and ordering?, you're kidding me.  This one gets under your skin, should be required reading, and is just ridiculously prescient.
