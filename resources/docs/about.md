A friend of mine publishes a magazine called
[Three Recordsï»¿](http://www.chrissypiper.com/3-records-zine).  The
premise is simple; pick three records that changed your life, changed
how you think about the world, or just made a huge impact.  This is
that but for papers.  Choose three papers, only 3, provide a link and
a story (story optional).
